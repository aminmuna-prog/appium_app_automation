## Calculator app automation with Appium and TestNG
### Project Summary: 
####  Here I automates the testing of a calculator application using Appium and TestNG.The primary goal is to validate the correctness of various arithmetic operations based on input series.
#### The test cases are designed to evaluate differen expressions and validate their outputs against expected results.I have taken input from CSV file.
### what I have done:
- Created function that takes a mathematical series as a parameter and performs the calculation.
- A separate function reads a series of calculations from a CSV file, evaluates them, and asserts the results.
### Tools I have used
- Java
- Appium server 
- TestNG
- Allure TestNG
